# OpenGL: Solar System Visualization

This project was created for an assignment in the course 3d-graphics at Linnaeus University. The visualization is written using directly OpenGL APIs which are exposed by JOGL.
The size of planets and their orbits is not to scale but the rotation and speed of planets is.

Controls for using are

* ``+`` double the speed
* ``-`` half the speed
* ``e`` move camera position up
* ``q`` move camera position down
* ``w`` move camera position forward
* ``s`` move camera position backward
* ``d`` move camera position right
* ``a`` move camera position left
* ``↑`` rotate camera upwards
* ``↓`` rotate camera downwards
* ``→`` rotate camera right
* ``←`` rotate camera left
